# LydiaTest

# Installation

Open and build the program

# Purpose

Build an app that fetches data from the service : http://randomuser.me

* Fetch 10 user for each api call
* Implement infinite scroll
* Handle connectivity (show the last result fetched)
* Create a details view who appears when the user touch an item in the list
* Has to be coded in swift
* Controllers should be made without storyboards

# Technical choices

I used the different libraries from Swift like:

* Core data for the data persistence 
* Codable for the conversion of the data
* MVVM fot the architecture
* UIKit for the views
* SystemConfiguration to get the connection status of the device

# Estimation

I estimated the project to be coded in about 9 or 10 hours, but i had never used Core Data in that way (with fetching data from an api) so it tooks me more time to fully understand the process and deal with the multi threading to avoid problems.
I also take a little more time to make a correct UI.
